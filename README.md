# CPU_Schedular_Simulator_C-_Linux

This is a C++ code written and executed on Linux(Ubuntu) to simulate the following scheduling methods, and produce the corresponding waiting time as output on a text file, after collecting Burst Time, Arrival Time and Priority for each process from an input text file:

1. First Come First Served
     Process Waiting Times:
     P1: 0 ms
     P2: 4 ms
     P3: 8 ms
     P4: 10 ms
     P5: 13 ms
     Average Waiting Time: 7 ms

2. Shortest Job First – Non-Preemptive
     Process Waiting Times:
     P1: 0 ms
     P2: 10 ms
     P3: 4 ms
     P4: 13 ms
     P5: 5 ms
     Average Waiting Time: 6.4 ms
     
3. Shortest Job First – Non-Preemptive
     Process Waiting Times:
     P1: 0 ms
     P2: 10 ms
     P3: 4 ms
     P4: 13 ms
     P5: 5 ms
     Average Waiting Time: 6.4 ms

4. Shortest Job First –Preemptive
     Process Waiting Times:
     P1: 6 ms
     P2: 10 ms
     P3: 0 ms
     P4: 13 ms
     P5: 1 ms
     Average Waiting Time: 6 ms

5. Priority Scheduling –Preemptive
     Process Waiting Times:
     P1: 14 ms
     P2: 6 ms
     P3: 0 ms
     P4: 9 ms
     P5: 1 ms
     Average Waiting Time: 6 ms
     
6. Round Robin Scheduling – time_quantum=2
     Process Waiting Times:
     P1: 14 ms
     P2: 9 ms
     P3: 11 ms
     P4: 11 ms
     P5: 12 ms
     Average Waiting Time: 11.4 ms
